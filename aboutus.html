    <p>I noticed this place soon after we moved to Orem and my interest was piqued. A few months went by, we were very busy, and didn't get around to trying The Hitching Post until last month. After trying a lot of other places in Orem to get a beer, I didn't have high hopes: I was sick of having to order food just to enjoy going out for a drink.</p>
    <p> Well, The Hitching Post is a REAL BAR. A DIVE BAR. You do not have to order food. No one gives you the hairy eyeball for sitting and drinking. The prices are decent, the bartenders are good, and the atmosphere is cosy.</p>
    <p> I like the bars in Provo okay, but they tend to be quite loud and even a bit smelly. The Hitching Post manages to be a comfortable dive while still maintaining an atmosphere in which you can carry on a conversation. It feels like a dad's basement circa 1982, in a good way: wood-paneled walls, lots of beer posters, football insignia, and ads for local businesses on the ceiling tiles. The bartender told me that they have NFL Network and play several different games on their TVs during the season. Perfect.</p>
